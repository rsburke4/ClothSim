# Cloth Simulation

This framework, build on OpenGL, is capable of running several physics simulations including basic particles, flocks, rigid bodies, and cloth.
The main branch contains an instance of a cloth simulation using this framework.
To run the simulation:

make clean
make
make sim
./pbalite

Upon initializing, the simulation may not be apparently visible. The default forces acting on the cloth may be too high. To fix this, with the window active, hold down the 't' key and press 'r' to reset the simulation. This lowers the timestep the simulation uses.
With the window active, press the 'u' key to see additional options for force parameters.
